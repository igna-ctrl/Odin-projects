    When we grill beef ribs in North America, we typically use cuts that require a long, slow roast and lots of basting for tender and flavorful results. 
    In Argentina, ribs are cut differently—crosswise across the bone—so that each piece has larger, thin portions of rib meat interspersed with smaller pieces of bone. When the rib meat is butchered this way, there is less connective tissue and the meat can cook quickly on a very hot grill without becoming tough. This cut is often called "flanken-style" in U.S. supermarkets and is popular for Korean barbecue ribs.
    In Argentina, these flanken-style ribs are treated simply with only a generous seasoning of salt before they go on the grill (ideally with some hardwood smoke for flavor). The ribs cook in 10 to 12 minutes, perfect for when you need dinner quickly. They are excellent when paired with garlicky chimichurri sauce.

    <strong>Ingredients:</strong>>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 1/2 to 2 pounds flanken-style ribs</li>
        <li>1 to 2 tablespoons kosher saltl</li>
        <li>Chimichurri sauce, for servin</li>
        
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Steps:</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the ribs on a plate or platter, and sprinkle both sides generously with the kosher salt. Let ribs sit at room temperature while the grill heats to medium-high (using charcoal with some wood chips for best flavor).

        </li>
        <li>Grill ribs for 4 to 6 minutes on each side, to the desired doneness. Cut into a rib to test for doneness (use the handy ​gaucho knife tucked into your belt for true authenticity).</li>
        <li>Serve right off the grill with chimichurri sauce on the side.</li>
    </ol>
